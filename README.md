# Budget Planner app
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dylankenneally/budget-planner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dylankenneally/budget-planner)

- The goal of this project is to write and deploy a basic personal budget web app, loosely based on [ASIC's Budget Planner](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/tools-and-resources/calculators-and-apps/budget-planner).
- The motivation for this project is to further explore a variety of different web technologies and how to piece them together, to help me learn new tech as well as deepen my knowledge of tech that I'm already using
