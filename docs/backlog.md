# Backlog of items to do for the Budget Planner app
- Not prioritised / groomed, more of a dump of items, not complete
- Would be better to move items over to projects/issues at https://github.com/dylankenneally/budget-planner/projects ?
  - Using github projects as mini sprints?

## Guiding principles
- An application to **explore new technology**, as well as be a **public example** of model web based tech for interested parties
- The idea is to **fine tune** skills, learn **new techniques** and explore tech I don't have time to look at during work hours
- Must still be **functional**, working, software
- The code doesn't need to be perfect, the above are more important for this **experiment**
- Must be **responsive**, mobile ready
