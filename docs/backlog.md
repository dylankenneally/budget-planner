# Backlog of items to do for the Budget Planner app
## Not prioritised / groomed, more of a dump of items

## Guiding principles
- An application to **explore new technology**, as well as be a **public example** of model web based tech for interested parties
- The idea is to **fine tune** skills, learn **new techniques** and explore tech I don't have time to look at during work hours
- Must still be **functional**, working, software
- The code doesn't need to be perfect, the above are more important for this **experiment**
- Must be **responsive**, mobile ready

## Tech stack to work with
- [ ] Node JS
- [ ] React JS, inc. hooks
- [ ] Material UI
- [ ] Travis CI/CD
- [ ] i18next
- [ ] eslint
- [ ] Redux, maybe
- [ ] Docker, maybe

## Build infrastructure
